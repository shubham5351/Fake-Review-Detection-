> Hate Speech detection using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement

Problem Statement - 
Hate Speech are a words, actions which is prohibited because it leads to acts that trigger violence attitude towards other individuals or groups. So in this project we are detecting such hate speech words and try to find it and prohibit such words from being lead to violence. We have also deployed the model Using Flask.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn 
- Flask

``` git clone https://github.com/shubham5351/Hate-Speech-Detection.git ```

2) go to the proper directory of cloned repo and Run app.py<br>
``` python app.py```

3) Visit the localhost:8000 or the link provided to see your application running.This is the screen after running successfully.<br>
